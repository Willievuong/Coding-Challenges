# You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

# record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
# get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.
# You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.


# Add the order_id to the log 
def record(order_id):
    print("Recording ", order_id)


# Get the ith last element from the log, i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N 
def get_last(i):





# Record Last N
def record_last(N):
